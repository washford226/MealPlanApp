### **Get Started**

#### 1. Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies for both the backend and frontend.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
```

#### 2. Set Up the Database

Make sure you have MySQL installed and running. Create a database and the required tables:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE meal_plan_app;

USE meal_plan_app;

CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    calories_goal INT DEFAULT NULL,
    dietary_restrictions TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
    profile_picture BLOB DEFAULT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

... -- (Check SQl file for all tables)
```

#### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Make sure that the env file is correct with all of your data:

```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
DB_NAME=meal_plan_app
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password
```

Replace `yourpassword`, `your_jwt_secret`, `your_email@gmail.com`, and `your_email_password` with your actual database credentials and email configuration.

#### 4. Start the Backend Server

Navigate to the `backend` directory and start the server:

```bash
cd backend
npm run server
```

#### 5. Start the Frontend App

Navigate to the `frontend` directory and start the app:

```bash
npx expo start
```
Run on an Android emulator for the best experience. 
If running on the web, please note that errors may not display properly and could cause the server to stop unexpectedly. 
Exercise caution and ensure all inputs and actions are correct when using the web version.
